- **Drink** – **The birthplace of the Rum Plantation**. Nimoi’s Bay’s rum is exported across the seas. **Converted into grog for ships**, but drunk **straight in its famous bars**.  
- **Culture** – **A melting pot of seafarers**, transcending **nation, race, or creed**. This is the **heart of the pirate world**.  
- **Marriage** –  Life on the seas is lonely, even the locals tend to be free spirits, but the chapel does provide the service and many have drunkenly become lawfully wed. Like most of society’s norms, here it is forgotten and tossed aside
- **Outsiders** – Only in Dragon’s Cairn are newcomers so efficiently sucked dry of their wealth in the pursuit of fun and thrills. The locals get fat off of being friendly as the wealth of acquired treasure spills into their pockets. However, they are always on the look-out for trouble: spies, bounty hunters and assassins who wish to disrupt the trade. 
- **Violence** – This is a sanctuary and those who cannot maintain it are consigned to their vessels. A strong mutual sense of defence is the only thing that keeps the bay in order. 
- **Slavery** – **No authority to forbid it**, but **many object to the practice**. Slaves are traded and trafficked, but it is **spontaneous rather than organised**.  
- **Magic** – **Supervised by locals**. **Flexing magical power** is a **major overstep**, but **who will stop you?**  
- **Money** – Here, **money is to be spent, and in great quantity**. Hoarders are **teased and heckled**.  
- **Family** – **A land of orphans and black sheep**. Few with **strong family ties** end up here.  
- **Death** – The **Captains decide** how pirates are buried. Locals are **served by the church**. Death is **inevitable and should be met with courage and camaraderie**.  
- **Religion** – The church is **tolerated** in exchange for maintaining a **chapel**. **Respect and tolerance are expected** to preserve sanctuary.
