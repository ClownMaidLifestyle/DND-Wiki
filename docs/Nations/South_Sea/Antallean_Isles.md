# The Antallean Isles  

## Government  

**Government Type:** League  
**Ruled by:** Various Houses  
**Government Unity:** Loose Alliance  
**Government Description:**  
Little more than a **loose alliance**—based on **preserving Antallean culture**, maintaining a **common dialect**, and **repelling future invasions**. The various houses **still wage petty wars** amongst themselves.  

Houses rule through **power**, but they **satiate the people** and justify their rule based on **cultural works**—the idea of **philosopher or poet kings** is the **archetype** of a successful ruler.  

### The most prominent houses are:
- **House Marcomani** – An **ancient house**, Marcomani was already in the **Antallean Isles** before the other houses fled the mainland. They have **weathered the instability** of the past and now form the **cultural cornerstone** of the Isles. They are **northern**.  
- **House Gnosus** – The **Ambrosia Grove**, a sacred site for the people of the Isles, sits in their land. By providing **access to it** and hosting **thinkers and theologians** from other houses, Gnosus has built a **web of alliances** that provides **security and comfort**.  
- **House Duthos** – **Relative newcomers** on the scene, House Duthos incited a **slave revolt**, slaughtering the previous ruling family of their islands. They **did not end slavery**, merely **inverted the classes**, making **loyal citizens and soldiers** out of their compatriots.  
- **House Garras** – With an **impressive fleet**, Garras provides some of the **most prominent sailors** in the Isles. When **trade ships go east** or **slave runs scour the coasts**, it’s **probably Garras**.
