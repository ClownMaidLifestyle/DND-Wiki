# Imhotep  

## Government  

**Government Type:** Absolute Monarchy  
**Ruled by:** Amunra  
**Government Unity:** Unitarian  
**Government Description:**  
When Amunra dies, his successor becomes Amunra, eagerly waiting to embody a God. The God-King’s Court, making up his trusted advisors such as Priests and Generals, are entrusted with keeping him informed on the comings and goings of the Nation, as well as enforcing his will.  

### The most prominent members of the God-King’s Court are:
- **Amunra** – The God-King himself, this is his third kingdom – having his successors killed and not replaced twice before. Few have seen him except behind lines of soldiers.  
- **General Kalel** – Responsible for the western border, he is infamous among the Tabaxi for his cruelty in defence of their raids.  
- **Priestess Guhamen** – Very popular amongst the people, Guhamen is an outspoken advocate for the welfare of Imhotep’s citizens.  
- **Citizen Takrat** – Being surrounded by disorganised tribes and raiders, the God-King has little use for spies. If he did have need, Citizen Maxo would provide them.  
- **Governor Hatset** – He resides in Eastern Imhotep and represents its people and culture. He is fair and even-handed but willing to defend the autonomy of his homeland.  

### **National Ambition:** Retake Kenkuia  

## Culture  

**Currency:** Aurats  
**Capital:** Amunrapolis  
**Symbol:** The Circle of Amunra  
**Values:** Loyalty, Devotion, Civilisation  

**National Stereotype:** Hard workers, Suspicious, Disciplined, Hagglers  

### Popular Entertainment:
- **Lower classes:** Tekhi – music and large jars of beer. Usually open in the mid-day where the high sun makes outside work impossible. Board games (an Imhotep speciality).  
- **Upper classes:** Hunts, Parades, Board games, Orchard/Garden cultivation (status symbol).  

### Social Attitudes:
- **Nobility** – The God-King transcends all mortal authority, but the priest class carries his word with them. Everyone else is his humble servant.  
- **Drink** – Tekhi only serve beer in large clay jars, to be drunk communally in reed straws. The midday sun makes work unbearable, drinking in the Tekhi is the standard relief.  
- **Culture** – Outside kingly ceremonies, culture is treated casually. There is no great love of recreation or the arts but a subtle appreciation. Work takes priority, and recreation mostly occurs when the conditions for work become too difficult.  
- **Marriage** – It is heavily encouraged to marry inside your social class. Marriage is a sober affair, taking place in the privacy of temple chambers with just the couple and the priests.  
- **Outsiders** – Outsiders are more of a peculiarity than anything. Few visit deep into Imhotep. Most residents will only see captives and Dust Devil bandits.  
- **Violence** – Martial Arts as a form of discipline and self-control is a popular idea. Restraining from extreme force is more honourable and respected than great violence. The Dragonborn are innately powerful; it is how they manage their power that makes their character.  
- **Slavery** – War captives are put to service for the state. Labour is also extracted as tax. As all belongs to the God-King, this is his right.  
- **Magic** – Similar to violence, control and discipline are critical for how magic is viewed.  
- **Money** – Finances are managed by the household, a modest but important duty.  
- **Family** – Families share larger home complexes to share the burden of tax – usually with a central courtyard and plenty of bedrooms. Families are responsible for each other, making good behaviour essential.  
- **Death** – Souls are excised from bodies, and then the bodies are entombed. Death is not the end in service to the God-King.  
- **Religion** – Paranoia rules as the Sutekh root out heretics and loyal servants report rumours to the priesthood. Devotion is expected and affirmed.  

## Traditions  

- **The Day of Descent** – Since time immemorial, the followers of Amunra have celebrated the day he embraced the mortal realm and led his people under a glorious kingdom.  
- **Successor’s Day** – Amunra’s chosen next host lives a life of lavish luxury until their time comes. On this day, the Sutekh parade them through the streets of Amunrapolis while the priests shower them with gifts.  
- **Vegetarianism** – The Dragonborn have a strong attitude relating to their abandoning of their beastly ways. In the east, some have even taken to the extreme of abandoning the consumption of meat. This is an extension of the old practices of eating stillborn eggs and the dead.

**Armed Forces:** The Army of the Sun  
**Army Professionalism:** Paid soldiers, Pledge taxers.  
**Peacekeeping:** Army  
**Army Composition:**  
- The Army of the Sun is a huge expense for Amunra. He is keen to prevent his previous deaths and, as such, maintains a large force that is built to cover everything from assassinations, with his royal guard, to defending the border from raids.  
- He keeps his generals’ powers limited and moves soldiers around to limit how much they remain loyal to their general rather than him.  
- The core of the army is built of professional soldiers, but the majority of troops are pledge taxers.  
- Household taxes may be collected in goods and revenue but also in service to the Army of the Sun for five years. Pledge taxers report directly to captains in the core force and enjoy few privileges.  

**Naval Forces:** The Navy of the Sun  
**Naval Professionalism:** Levies, Mercenaries  
**Naval Composition:**  
- The local sailors, usually backed up by foreign mercenaries to bolster their numbers with strong foreign ships, are frequently sent to protect trade and ward off slavers and pirates that haunt the calm waters.

- Revenge killings also occur with some frequency.  
- Banditry props up around dry seasons but generally, when prosperity returns, the bandits abandon the lifestyle.  
- Vigilantes, trained in the art of the Medjay, often hunt criminals and bandits but do so while evading the law, lest they be accused of being traitors for associating with the Medjay.  
- Some of the most heinous crimes a Dragonborn can commit are the eating of failed eggs and of the dead – these practices that were once common in the calorie-deficient desert are now considered barbaric and animalistic.
