# Em Onol

## Government

**Government Type:** Constitutional Monarchy  
**Ruled by:** Etar (Dwarven for King) Ralath and the Sworn Council  
**Government Unity:** Unitarian  
**Government Description:**  
The king is the unifying force behind Em Onol, though his every move is bound by the **Sworn Council** and their rulings. Their long list of previous rulings remains in effect until revoked by the council, making some of the laws **hundreds of years old**.  

### The most prominent peers of the realm are:
- **Etar Ralath** – The Etar is comfortable in his life as a figurehead. His reign has been full of stability and peace; he is popular, though the world can only guess how he would handle a challenge.  
- **Councillor Dalak** – Dalak spent her childhood on the **Upback**, unusual for a council member. She bills herself as a folksy, down-to-earth, woman of the people.  
- **Councillor Dumor** – An ex-**Irak Ezesh** fighter, he returned home disabled and avidly supports the fighters in the east and the many refugees at home at every chance he gets.  
- **Councillor Ikesh** – An avid isolationist, Ikesh prefers to limit contact with other nations and races.  

### **National Ambition:** Restoration of **Sital Omol** as a Kingdom  

## Culture

**Currency:** Gusil  
**Capital:** Nalishdumed  
**Symbol:** Udirkimel  
**Values:** Community, Industry, Thrift  
**National Stereotype:** Stubborn, Hagglers, Complainers, No sense of humour  

### Popular Entertainment:
- **Lower classes:** Mead halls, Opera  
- **Upper classes:** Mead halls, Opera, Debate halls  

### Social Attitudes:
- **Nobility** – Lines of nobility are ancient and respected, but good performance in the bureaucracy is a good substitute.  
- **Drink** – **Ucat** is a cheap mushroom-based beer enjoyed in the cities, but mead, brewed in the Upback, is the famous drink. Drinking is a famous dwarven pastime.  
- **Culture** – Outsiders see dwarven culture as very dry, but the truth is **dwarves have very long attention spans**. The rush of excitement is de-emphasised in favour of satisfying conclusions. Not playing an instrument is considered rather odd.  
- **Marriage** – Marriage is a public and celebrated event, love being at the centrepiece.  
- **Outsiders** – Humans are common and familiar, even elves from the Imperium make visits for trade. However, the dwarves prefer to mind their own affairs and are rather private in personal matters.  
- **Violence** – Violence is a plague of the weak. **Dwarven strength comes from resilience, not outbursts of violence**.  
- **Slavery** – Taking pride in your work and doing it yourself is far more important than getting it done easier or quicker with slaves. Nobody under captivity can produce their best work—it is **undignified and barbaric** to keep them.  
- **Magic** – In the long lives of dwarves, magic becomes very normal and well understood—it is a craft like any other.  
- **Money** – Accumulation of wealth is **accumulation of pride**; it is a celebration of one’s achievements.  
- **Family** – Family is highly important, particularly whether you are from a city or Upback family. One can transcend their station through great work, but those from a strong family get the best tutors and materials.  
- **Death** – Funerals are long and drawn out. Bodies are interred in tombs or cairns. **Long lives lead to heartbreaking deaths**—few mourn as deeply as dwarves. It is also a great administrative effort to arrange the possessions of the dead.  
- **Religion** – Religious duty is civic duty in the cities but more personal in the Upback.  

## Traditions

- **The Etar’s Noton** – His official birthday. During this week, the **Etar** tours the cities and gives a long speech at each, often meeting and greeting city officials. Craftsmen sell commemorative wares while people crowd the streets hoping to get a glimpse of the great Etar. He spends his birthday proper at **Nalishdumed**.
