The Senate has a total of 78 seats, representing an equal number of Boroughs. While there are no official parties, a number of factions have formed over the course of the senate’s history. 

Elections take place each five years. After a senate is elected, their inaugural actions are to select candidates for each governmental position. Some of these are members of the senate themselves whereas others must be apolitical. 

**Factions:**

**National Movement:** Petr Salasse’s National Movement advocates for a stronger military force and an end to the senate’s lax attitude to criminal enterprises. At their core is a belief in the inherent greatness of Dragon’s Cairn political system and the perfidiousness of foreign enemies.  

**Seamen's Union:** A faction purported to represent the naval trade headed by Gorinth Searren. Their leader is renowned for his brash behaviour. It’s a well known secret that the Seamen’s Union has links with criminal enterprises. They lobby for more investment in the docklands and better deals for naval companies. 

**Centrist Bloc:** The centrist bloc consider themselves a continuation of the founding expeditions of Dragon’s Cairn. They seek to maintain the fabric of the republic in its original intention, opposing any major shifts in the status quo from the other factions. This is the most formally organised faction - the bloc’s general secretary is Jehu Farrowtail

**Radical Citizens: ‘**Votes for all!’ That is the demand of the Radical Citizens. While controversial among the ruling merchant class, their working supporters are passionate in promoting the cause. This is not a recipe for electoral success but a core contingent of enlightened intelligentsia representing them in the senate, spawned from the young, cultured  and educated elite

**Sacred Path:** The firebrand religious organisation has two representatives on the senate. Normally such an organisation would never be allowed to hold power, under the Republic’s binding laws. However, The Sacred Path is officially only a study group and it can’t be proven that their senators take orders on how to vote from the group’s committee

**Unaffiliated:** The unassociated rabble are an eccentric mix of senators, some searching for prestige or influence for themselves. They mostly represent the rural boroughs which have a smaller number of voters and less competition from the factions. 

**(Banned) Monarchists:** Forbidden from participation in the senate by the binding laws, There are those who wish for an end to merchant rule and the establishment of a kingdom. Some of these are Regitoisan sympathisers who want their regency to extend to Dragon’s Cairn, others seek the establishment of an independent Cairnian Monarchy to be a stable, guiding light. 

**Government:**

**Speaker of the House:** The Centrist Bloc historically controls this position, with considerable support from the unaffiliated senate. The speaker must be a senator.

**Keymasters of the Treasury:** Elected to manage the finances of the Republic, the keymasters are usually senators with a financial background. Two are elected as a measure to prevent fraud and theft. 

**Peacekeeper General:** Captains of the Republican Guard are elected to this position for admirable service. Usually the incumbent Peacekeeper General is allowed to continue in the role, unless the senate desires to calm public unrest by replacing an unpopular one. 

**General of Arms:** This position is usually left empty until a conflict escalates with another power. A member of the senate would then take the role, overruling the Peacekeeper General and requisitioning resources from them.. The National Movement advocates for this position to be permanently filled.

**Merchant Admiral:** Analogous to the Peacekeeper General, the Merchant Admiral is charged with overseeing the Merchant Navy. Any ship’s captain or naval merchant may nominate themselves for the role. 

**High Adjudicator:** Accredited Solicitors of the Merchant’s Guild of Solicitors nominate their own High Adjudicator - who is then ascended with consent of the senate - to regulate the guild and ensure its practices align with the law.
