# Regitoise

## Government

**Government Type:** Regency  
**Ruled by:** The Lord-Regent Dubois  
**Government Unity:** Feudal  
**Government Description:**  
The **court of the imperial majesty** sits with an empty throne. The next highest authority in the land—the **Duke of Regitoise**—has become the **permanent de facto ruler**, while the nobility holds out faint hope for a reunification of the human lands.  

### The most prominent lords of the land are:
- **The Regent Duke Dubois of Regitoise** – A haughty and proud man. The Regent Duke is difficult to get an audience with. Some say he is preserving the culture and traditions of the **imperial past**; some say he is stuck in the past.  
- **Governess Carolinia of Moroneise** – Moroneise is the **silk road of Regitoise**, being well placed for homegrown mines and dwarven trade. This makes the Governess rather wealthy. She doesn’t care for politics, except for ensuring the **Dwarves in her south remain friendly**.  
- **Martial Garmond of Alivous** – On the border with **The Boughlands** and **Antoine**, the Maquis bears the **brunt of any skirmishes and border disputes**. This makes him very respected in the courts, but he is also very jaded and **more eager for conquest** than his compatriots.  
- **Governor Louvie of Martise** – While lacking in land compared to others, the county of **Martise** is the last land before the **Elven territory** begins. By necessity, he has become the **nation’s spymaster**, hoping to buy himself some time should they ever return to finish the job.
