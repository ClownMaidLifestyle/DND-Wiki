# The Boughlands

## Government

**Government Type:** Assembly of Clans under Monarchy  
**Ruled by:** King Burymead  
**Government Unity:** Federal  
**Government Description:**  
To keep the **High Boughlands** and **Low Boughlands** united, an **assembly of clans** pledges fealty to the **Lower Boughlander King**. The king has little power over the clans, but they legitimise his rule—the king gets the **military might of the High Boughlands** behind him, and the clans stay united against any foes.  

### The most prominent members of the Assembly of Clans are:
- **King Burymead** – An **old man**, King Burymead is **highly respected for his age and wisdom**, though he has little interest in the affairs of the clans, leading to **power struggles**.  
- **Clan McNeary** – As rowdy as they get, **Clan McNeary** are famous for their **wild weddings and parties**, as well as their **propensity for using fistfights** to get their way.  
- **Clan Tannigan** – What they lack in numbers, they make up for in **cunning and ruthlessness**. One does not cross a **Tannigan** lightly.  
- **Clan Farrowan** – This **enterprising clan’s** success is largely a result of their **selective breeding of highland cows** into **bigger and tastier variants** that are popular abroad. This **money brings them unusual influence** in the Boughlands.  

## Culture

### Social Attitudes:

- **Drink** – A **social affair** for cheaper **meads and ales**. **Whisky and Antallian wine** are **rare treats** reserved for **guests and special occasions**. Whisky is often brewed by clans.  
- **Culture** – Dancing is a **ubiquitous complement to music**, and both are enjoyed by all. The **culture is insular**, resistant to change from outsiders, and sticks to tradition where possible.  
- **Marriage** – The **Low Boughlanders** follow the same customs as **continental humans**. The **High Boughlanders** require a **clan leader** to approve marriages—marriages with those with no clan ties are **taboo**, and the **prestige and relations with the clan** of the marriage candidate are **highly important**.  
- **Outsiders** – **Generally welcome** across the land. The **Boughlanders feel secure and safe**, and as such **do not fear newcomers**.  
- **Violence** – A **good punch-up** gets conflict **out of the system**. It is unseemly for **older people**, but **expected among the spry young**. **Inter-clan fights are taken personally** by most clan members.  
- **Slavery** – Prohibited on **religious grounds**, socially abhorrent. Even the otherwise **acceptable indentured servitude system** is **illegal** in the Boughlands, as the **only acceptable form of legal bond** is to **king or clan**.  
- **Magic** – Treated with **reverence and fear**. Tales of the **Druids** frighten children and impress adults alike. It is **not to be treated or used lightly**.  
- **Money** – **Assets are more important than coins**. Clans usually have a **shared coffer**, which employed members are expected to **contribute to**, with **allowance for personal funds**. This gets **complicated** with city-dwelling clanfolk.  
- **Family** – **The clan is the family unit**. Cousins and nephews are no different from siblings and children.  
- **Death** – Bodies are **burned**. Near churches, **funerary rites** are performed by the **church**, but more **rural people** perform the rites **themselves**.  
- **Religion** – **Nominally important**, but often **lost in the fray** of Boughlander pride and clan politics. The **church is respected**, but also **expected to keep out of internal affairs**.
