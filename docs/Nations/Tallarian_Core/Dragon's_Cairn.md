# Dragon’s Cairn

## Government

**Government Type:** Merchant Republic  
**Ruled by:** Citizen’s Senate  
**Government Unity:** Unitary  
**Government Description:**  
Landowners are permitted to vote and participate in the Citizen’s Senate. The island is split into districts, which are further divided into boroughs. Each borough gets a member of the senate, totalling 78.  

The country senators often have safe seats, with only a few people owning estates in some boroughs. However, city seats have true influence, and all prominent politicians have a city borough.  

The senate’s main responsibility is managing taxation and the provision of services such as the **Republican Guard** and the **Merchant’s Navy**. The senate shows little interest in regulating private life but is stringent in ensuring a strong economy and that merchants have a stable career with few major upsets.  

### The most prominent career politicians are:
- **Jehu Farrowtail** – An elderly gnomish industrialist who sees manufacturing and stout diplomacy as the future. A stalwart radical centrist.  
- **Petr Salasse** – Of Regitoise origin, he hopes to see a stronger, nationalist government. Resents the institutional crime of Dragon’s Cairn.  
- **Giovanna Dumoi** – A soft radical who seeks to expand democracy, making enemies. Maintains her precarious position through personal favours and debts, a true believer.  
- **Gorinth Searren** – Famously represents the naval trade in the senate. A known bully with cronies in his pocket.  

## Culture

**Currency:** New Denari  
**Capital:** Dragon’s Cairn City  
**Symbol:** The Black Goat of Farradon  
**Values:** Individualism, Enterprise, Industry  
**National Stereotype:** Busy, Fast-talkers, Untrustworthy, Hagglers  

### Social Attitudes:
- **Nobility** – Everyone is expected to stand on their own two feet. Prestige and standing must be earned, not inherited. The foreign nobility are well treated and accommodated, but nobility has no place in Cairnian society.  
- **Drink** – Attitudes are highly mixed. Hedonists are admonished by the **Sacred Path**, but many enjoy a break from the realities of industrial work. Many fine imports are available, even to middle-income craftsmen if they save up.  
- **Culture** – Here, all culture is in a state of flux and experimentation, with customs from across the world blending together to create a uniquely Dragon’s Cairn style. Every niche is catered for if you know where to look.  
- **Marriage** – The church is permitted to officiate weddings, but the state provides that service independently for the non-human population.  
- **Outsiders** – The naive foreigner may think the streets are paved with gold from the promises of sailors and recruiters, but the truth can be far from that fantasy. Many move here in search of money and find poverty and crime instead, joining the ranks of the working population. Others make it. Some are simply tourists and have a pleasant time. All are expected and commonplace for the locals. Judgement is sometimes based on racial lines, as continental conflicts bleed over into street violence.  
- **Violence** – To the resentment of the working man, gangs and the guard alike are happy to push and shove to control the populace. Peace is heavily kept in touristed areas, but in the working quarters, it’s very easy to slip through the cracks and wind up dead.  
- **Slavery** – The promise of individual liberty and a fortune to be had are tantamount to the social fabric. There are no masters here. But punishing contracts can feel just the same as forced servitude once they’ve been signed.  
- **Magic** – With exemptions for authorised professions, the public use of magic is prohibited. Express permission must be granted due to the grave danger it poses to the public. A flash in a crowd could lead to panic.  
- **Money** – Money is what keeps your head above the water and what determines which opportunities you have access to. More than anywhere else in the world, you are worth the coin in your purse.  
- **Family** – While wider society may have embraced the republic, the family unit is still a kingdom. Short only of financial ruin, it is a complete disgrace to fail to provide for your family. Loyalty is usually expected in return.  
- **Death** – The handful of churches on the island billow smoke constantly from the bodies of the dead. Other provisions are available but more specialist and expensive. Most people have a short service at their closest church—death is a family matter.  
- **Religion** – Anybody is welcome to choose their creed, but the church is treated with heavy scepticism, and this applies also to other groups. Those of a creed tend to stick together in the same neighbourhoods or otherwise keep their faith private. Some more active evangelists rub civil society the wrong way.  

## Popular Entertainment

- **Lower classes:** Gambling, Theatre (comedies and burlesque), Quarterhouses (local brown pubs).  
- **Upper classes:** Theatre (Classical, Antallean is popular amongst the youth), Hunting clubs (popular countryside social clubs), City Card Clubs.  

## Traditions

- **Landing Day** – An early spring festival dedicated to the colonisation of Dragon’s Cairn. Celebrated with street parades, a rare event where upper and lower classes mingle directly.  
- **Dragon’s Eve** – It is said the Dragon buried under Dragon’s Cairn can kill just by looking at someone. On this day, everyone parties in highly decorated masks to fool the dragon into not recognising them, should it escape.  
- A variety of religious holidays are celebrated with official support.
