# Antoine

## Government

**Government Type:** Elective Monarchy  
**Ruled by:** King Savois  
**Government Unity:** Feudal  
**Government Description:**  
The alliance of lords that makes up the Kingdom of Antoine are keen on three things: Keeping Regitoise out, keeping the Boughlanders out, and keeping Southmarche out. Their key position among the human nations and lack of natural defences makes them united more by common enemies than anything else.

### The most prominent lords of the land are:
- **King Savois I** – His highness is a veteran, having seen combat from the tent to the front. His rousing speeches made him a popular candidate, but surrounded by foes he cannot fight, and managing a kingdom, his toughest battle is now.  
- **Duchess Serra** – The presumed successor, her grace is an experienced hand and acts as the king’s adviser. Her position is very secure, but she has little tolerance for her subordinates.  
- **Marquis Delamontalban** – They say the Marquis has narrowly avoided death more often than he’s had birthdays. Living on the border with Regitoise and Southmarche, Delamontalban is unlikely to ever have a key political position, but nonetheless, the kingdom has his back.  
- **Count McDuggan** – The McDuggan line made the controversial decision to stick with Antoine, despite being a Boughlander family. In the time since their mutual distrust, they have become a rare, precious link between the two peoples.  

## Culture

**Currency:** New Denari  
**Capital:** Renaire  
**Symbol:** The Drake of Lake Antoine  
**Values:** Loyalty, Comradery, Pride  
**National Stereotype:** Bitter, Distrustful, Loyal, Dutiful  

### Social Attitudes:
- **Nobility** – Derived from feudal lordship, taken highly seriously and harshly punished if disrespected.  
- **Drink** – Common, mead and beers being the preferred choice – wines aren’t popular given their association with Regitoise, but Boughlander whisky is a surprise hit among the elite.  
- **Culture** – For the well-to-do, associations form the basis of social culture and order. Most are keen for the national events, but none are more radical in their devotion than those who commemorate the martyrs in developing arts and traditions.  
- **Marriage** – Feudal marriages are tightly controlled by lords; otherwise, a loose hand is kept on who marries whom – so long as they are not foreign. Dowries are expected.  
- **Outsiders** – Beset by enemies, the world is not kind to Antoine, and it is not kind in return.  
- **Violence** – Every family should have a soldiering child; violence is a necessary part of continuing their way of life, and most should learn the basics of how to fight. However, it is not acceptable to turn your anger towards your neighbours.  
- **Slavery** – Indentured servitude is legitimate employment. Only war captives may be put to work, usually in the construction of fortifications or resource extraction. The church does not approve of this arrangement, but it is seen as a necessary evil.  
- **Magic** – A powerful tool, but not to be kept at home – magical children are sent to the capital to find proper training and use.  
- **Money** – Feudal lords extract large amounts of wealth, managing finances for whole villages. Personal money is used for petty purchases, except in the homes of merchants and knights.  
- **Family** – Many Antoine families have severed ties with those in Southmarche and Regitoise. These stories are passed down to children in a peculiar cultural quirk. Households usually consist of one parental unit, their children, and their elderly parents.  
- **Death** – Belongs to the church, though knights insist on managing the funerals of their comrades.  
- **Religion** – Relations with the church in Antoine are frayed, with the veneration of the saints and war captive labourers being frequent causes for concern. However, for the most part, people still attend and respect the church.  
- **Property** – Feudal lords ultimately own the land.

## Traditions

- **The Celebration of the Martyrs** – An unofficial holiday with growing popularity, the day involves lighting fires in memory of the martyrs and is highly associated with Antoine nationalist sentiment. Naturally, the celebration is not tolerated across the border in Regitoise.  
- **Commemoration Day** – Marking the anniversary of the Battle of Suislane Field. On this day, the Drakesmen and their lords go on parade in their best uniforms, and the farmers put their tools down to watch and eat. Usually, tournaments take place in the afternoon with a peculiar attraction occurring outside Renaire – a re-enactment of the battle for the public.  
- **The Lord’s Day** – The most important day in the religious calendar, the Lord’s Day should be dedicated to prayer, though in practice, many people do half-days.
