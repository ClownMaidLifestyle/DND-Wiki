# Mountain Orcs

## Government

**Government Type:** Horde  
**Ruled by:** Autonomous Troops  
**Government Unity:** Fragmentary  
**Government Description:**  
At the core of each Troop is a Korrat and their lieutenants. Lieutenants tussle over the individual loyalties of the Troop, but all answer to the Korrat. By right of conquest, the Troop belongs to whomever kills the current Korrat. With little space to split off or flee in the rugged mountains, breakaway groups are rare, making the Troops of the mountains remarkably stable and sedentary.

**Sitalen Etar Destat** is the most feared and respected Korrat, settled in the former capital and taking the dwarven title for king by right of conquest.

## Culture

**Currency:** N/A  
**Capital:** N/A  
**Symbol:** N/A  
**Values:** Cunning, Power, Dominance  
**National Stereotype:** Bulky, Loud, Vicious, Rowdy  

### Social Attitudes:

- **Nobility** – All must carve a path for themselves; prestige cannot be inherited. Lieutenants must be appointed, but the title of Korrat must be earned by right of conquest. Sitalen Etar Destat, by rights having usurped the authority of the dwarves, holds special privilege and consideration among the mountain orcs. His decrees and commandments, issued by his court of captured dwarves, are well heeded.  
- **Drink** – Commonly enjoyed; ciders and fruit brandy are brewed in small batches locally and brought in from the steppes, but **Ucat**, brewed from cave mushrooms, is batch-brewed in the mountains themselves.  
- **Culture** – Powerful vocals and percussion instruments are used to project power and respect. There is a strong oral storytelling tradition as little is written down; children are expected to memorise at least some tales of past glories. Dwarven idioms and expressions have made their way into the culture and even architectural tastes through imitation.  
- **Marriage** – No such union exists; free association is practised.  
- **Outsiders** – To be stalked like wolves. The wretched will be ignored, but those with wealth or numbers will be seen as a threat or opportunity and challenged.  
- **Violence** – The right of conquest is the basis of society, but lieutenants are expected to keep their gangs in line and prevent infighting. Violence is a personal affair; cunning plots are acceptable, but only one can claim the right of conquest. Splitting off from the Troop is exceedingly difficult due to the terrain and lack of space, so bouts of violence in the Troop are infrequent but bloody.  
- **Slavery** – Slave labour is taking hold but in its infancy, as captured **Irak Ezesh** fighters are put to work in quarrying and dangerous caving tasks. Intellectuals and artisans may be obliged to lend their skills to a Korrat, however. Bullying someone into joining a Troop is not considered slavery.  
- **Magic** – A powerful weapon to be harnessed at will, highly respected and feared.  
- **Money** – Useful for trading but otherwise has no meaning in society; obligation does not come from employment.  
- **Family** – Not highly regarded beyond child-rearing, where parents and children are often kept together. Surnames aren’t commonplace.  
- **Death** – The honourable dead have songs sung about them as they are buried in cairns. This is a natural part of life and not to be feared. To die is to have experienced life at its most potent.  
- **Religion** – A matter of personal preference, so long as it does not impede the hierarchy of the Troop. The Orcs are a forsaken people with no allegiances.
