# North Steppes

## Government

**Government Type:** Horde  
**Ruled by:** Independent Troops  
**Government Unity:** Fragmentary  
**Government Description:**  
At the core of each Troop is a Korrat and their lieutenants. Lieutenants tussle over the individual loyalties of the Troop but all answer to the Korrat. By right of conquest, the Troop belongs to whomever kills the current Korrat, though if the Troop is too large, some lieutenants may feel emboldened to split off from the rest of the Troop and start their own.

A single Korrat may lead a troop of a few hundred, but when an **Oi-Korrat** (Great Warlord) unites a large portion of the steppes, the lands tremble beneath their feet.

### The most prominent Korrats are:
- **Mughul Iron-Skull** – One of the older Korrats. He was there during the final days of **Sital Onol**—one of the early **Irak Ezesh** fighters split his skull, which is now kept together with an iron helmet.  
- **Golden Stone Nullam** – Named after a large jewel he stole from an old **Sital Onol** city. Controversially, he sold his prized war loot in exchange for Antoine arms and armour to an anonymous buyer.  
- **Gakat from the Depths** – Living deep within an old dwarven city, Gakat’s great influence comes from exporting deep quarry and metals to other Korrats.  

## Culture

**Currency:** N/A  
**Capital:** N/A  
**Symbol:** The North Steppe Skull  
**Values:** Cunning, Power, Dominance  
**National Stereotype:** Bulky, Loud, Vicious, Rowdy  

### Social Attitudes:
- **Nobility** – All must carve a path for themselves; prestige cannot be inherited. Lieutenants must be appointed, but the title of Korrat must be earned by right of conquest.  
- **Drink** – Commonly enjoyed. Fruits are collected while Troops travel to ferment into cider, and particularly patient brewers distil it into brandy.  
- **Culture** – Powerful vocals and percussion instruments are used to project power and respect. There is a strong oral storytelling tradition, as little is written down; children are expected to memorise at least some tales of past glories.  
- **Marriage** – No such union exists; free association is practised.  
- **Outsiders** – To be stalked like wolves. The wretched will be ignored, but those with wealth or numbers will be seen as a threat or opportunity and challenged.  
- **Violence** – The right of conquest is the basis of society. However, lieutenants are expected to keep their gangs in line and prevent infighting. Violence is a personal affair; cunning plots are acceptable, but only one can claim the right of conquest.  
- **Slavery** – Slave labour is too difficult to maintain and inspires no confidence. A leader shouldn’t need it. Intellectuals and artisans may be obliged to lend their skills to a Korrat, however. Bullying someone into joining a Troop is not considered slavery.  
- **Magic** – A powerful weapon to be harnessed at will, highly respected and feared.  
- **Money** – Useful for trading but otherwise has no meaning in society; obligation does not come from employment.  
- **Family** – Not highly regarded beyond child-rearing, where parents and children are often kept together. Surnames aren’t commonplace.  
- **Death** – The honourable dead have songs sung about them as they are buried in cairns. This is a natural part of life and not to be feared. To die is to have experienced life at its most potent.  
- **Religion** – A matter of personal preference, so long as it does not impede the hierarchy of the Troop. The Orcs are a forsaken people with no allegiances.
