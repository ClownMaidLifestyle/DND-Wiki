# Southmarche

## Government

**Government Type:** Monarchy  
**Ruled by:** King Sedaire  
**Government Unity:** Feudal  
**Government Description:**  
The lords of Southmarche are largely autonomous, given the difficulty of traversing the terrain. This leaves their kingdom as mostly a defensive alliance. Infighting is not unheard of between the petty lords of the kingdom.

### The most prominent lords of the land are:
- **King Sedaire II** – His main role is keeping the kingdom together. A fairly young man, he’s spry enough to make many journeys around the Marche to satiate and keep tabs on the lords of the land. Still, he is as superstitious as the next man.  
- **Duke Duclaire of Graypeak** – With the frontier of the northern steppe on his land, Duke Duclaire is hardly concerned with the internal politics of Southmarche. He maintains a small circle of allied lords to keep his position comfortable.  
- **Duke Fontaine of Deepmarche** – The duke is a troubled man. From the bog witches that stalk his lands to jealous lords with an eye on his pasture and farmland, he has a stressful holding.  
- **Count Renneise** – His home is filled with charms, dusty tomes, and mysterious relics. Some would accuse him of heresy, but he would argue he needs to understand the unnatural in order to combat it.  

### **National Ambition:** Holding back the steppes  

## Culture

**Currency:** New Denari  
**Capital:** Bletchmoore  
**Symbol:** The Dragon of Southmarche  
**Values:** Wisdom, Fairness, Poverty  
**National Stereotype:** Unhygienic, Superstitious, Unorthodox taste, Insular  

### Social Attitudes:
- **Nobility** – Feudal-based. Nobles are respected but are much closer to their communities than in other lands, with less ceremony and formal etiquette.  
- **Drink** – Commonly home-brewed as a replacement for unclean water, highly normalised.  
- **Culture** – Folk tales and tradition are revered as independently Southmarche, commonly mixing with the more pan-human noble culture.  
- **Marriage** – Monogamy expected, with folk marrying young. Among the peasantry, free choice of betrothal is accepted, but noble marriages are arranged. Dowries are expected for lost labour, paid to the family whose child is moving away.  
- **Outsiders** – Treated with healthy suspicion, but churches are expected to welcome travellers.  
- **Violence** – Town militia are expected to chase off monsters and protect communities, but violence within the town is stigmatised. Fights happen but are broken up.  
- **Slavery** – Prohibited on religious grounds. Indentured servitude is commonly employed by the nobility to staff their residences, but this is considered legitimate employment.  
- **Magic** – The domain of the church. It is a source of death and misery outside of the church, and it is a terrible omen if a community member develops magical powers. Its use is highly discouraged.  
- **Money** – Belongs to the household. Rural communities will prefer to avoid transacting money (except as payment for justice) with each other, as it is reserved for trade goods that must be bought in.  
- **Family** – Immediate family are expected to live together, with cousins not living far away. The family unit is an authority headed by the most capable elder couple.  
- **Death** – Bodies are burned to free the soul. Death is a bittersweet tragedy, with mourners praying that the Lord Trismegistus guides their soul upward.  
- **Religion** – The Church is a pillar of the community, and religious devotion is a key component of good character.  
- **Property** – Belongs to families, but ultimately land belongs to the liege.

## Traditions

- **All Spirits Day** – In the darkness of winter, it is said the spirits and monsters of the marsh are at their most active. The people of Southmarche leave little offerings marked with lit candles out in the marshes to placate the spirits. They usually spend the rest of the day inside, telling spooky stories.  
- **The Lord’s Day** – The most important day in the religious calendar. The Lord’s Day should be dedicated to prayer, though in practice, many people do half-days.  
- **Commemoration Day** – Marking the anniversary of the Battle of Suislane Field. Commemoration Day is a rather humble celebration of the independence of Southmarche. The lords meet the King in Bletchmoore in their finest, and medals are distributed to soldiers.
