Elves defeat the Terralian empire and massacre the imperial family
With no obvious successor to the throne two Generals tussle for control over the empire
General Pontifex emerges victorious and rules the empire in an oppressive military dictatorship. He has a cult of personality which rubs many people the wrong way.
Discontent from years of harsh military rule breeds resentment and an eventual independence movement in Antione and Southmarche.
Civil war breaks out in the empire once more, General Pontifex moves his forces east to crush the rebellion.
After feeling years of neglect and high taxes, and with the imperial forces away from home,  portions of the populous revolt.
Disobeying orders, General Tolum withdraws his forces from the eastern campaign to stabilise the home territories.
In a remarkable act of diplomacy, Tolum retakes control of the capital bloodlessly, convincing the revolutionaries that their goals are aligned.
Seeing Tolum as an upstart, General Pontifex withdraws from the east to confront Tolum.
Tolum and Pontifex  meet in battle, Pontifex goes down fighting and is killed at the battle of XXX Bridge.
Tolum the steady, after defeating Pontifex, installs himself as Duke Regent of Terralia. Conscious of his illegitimacy and not wanting to present himself as an emperor, he establishes the core doctrine of the Regency to locate the Imperial Heir and re-establish their legitimate line.
With the Empireâ€™s forces decimated from years of fighting and civil war, they are forced to withdraw entirely from the eastern territories, giving rise to the Petty Kingdom of Antione and the Kingdom of Southmarche putting an end to the civil war.
Years later, unsatisfied with the status quo, Tolem begins another eastern military campaign to retake the lost territories.
The campaign is short lived and they are defeated at the battle of Suislane Field, solidifying the rump.
Tolum returns home disgraced and dies shortly after from stress related illness. He reigned for 25 years.
A new regent is elected from the ruling council to  replace Tolum.
