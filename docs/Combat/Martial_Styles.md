**The Antallian Phalanx:**

Spears are a common and popular weapon in the isles, with swords making personal defence weapons. Soldiers and mercenaries are expected to fight in formation, travel light with only the armour they need and train to be practical. There is no ritual combat in the isles, if you fight you mean to kill or maim. 

**The Derbaine School:**

The most popular, but not only, set of treatises on Combat in the human realm. The Derbaine school teaches rigorous forms for combat from wrestling with daggers to wielding halberds. The treatises were primarily focused on teaching nobility how to fight in heavy armour, though many lower ranking soldiers have learned to adapt its forms. Longswords, Halberds, maces and Daggers are common favourites for their ability to manoeuvre the enemy or pierce armour respectively.

It is primarily based on controlling the distance between the enemy and manipulating their range of movement, as such grappling and barging techniques are commonly employed. 

Students of the school and former soldiers often teach it in the employ of a Lord both to their children and their levies. 

**Nokhzam:**

The Duthnur’s training regimen is prized for its excellent theories on the shield. Being short, Dwarves are taught to use a shield to close the gap with an opponent before using short blades and axes to target vital spots. The emphasis on shields also allows the Duthnur to control crowds effectively and capture groups or individuals in targeted actions. While generally seen as a defensive art, Nokhzam is actually more focused on allowing the Duthnur to push back or charge an opponent. 

**Azisdur:**

Where weapons are largely prohibited in the city, Self-defence schools have sprung up teaching a relatively newer art, Azisdur. The school is a double edged sword, making individual civilians safer but also acting as a training and recruitment den for organised criminals in some cases. The school teaches sturdy, powerful strikes and utilises the opponent’s movements to throw them against a wall or on the ground. The overall mantra is rather opposite to Nokhzam, which teaches closing the gap - Azisdur is focused on making one hard to approach. 

**Tahtib:**

The army of Imhotep primarily learns to fight with sticks before graduating to lethal weapons. This teaches them that anything can be a weapon in the right hands and to use the momentum of their own body to put pressure on an opponent. With deadly dragon breath, the use of javelins, sickles and spears - The art of Tahtib is aggressive in its form, with its best proponents beginning their next attack halfway through a block. 

**Medjay training:**

A dying art since the dissolution of the Medjay Union, the Medjay were trained in the arts of desert survival, navigation and tracking all in aid of capturing wanted criminals and enemies of the state. They are experts in ambushes and other rapid, decisive tactics, especially against foes in greater numbers or who are likely to flee. They use bows, nets and swords extensively and are notorious for fighting dirty. 

**Kenkuian Blade Dances:**

The knife is one of the most important objects a Kenku can own. Heavy disputes are often solved with the parties being thrown into a circle of their peers, knife in hand. Few attacks are made, with feints and lunges being a staple feature as the opponents circle each other. Sleight of hand is often employed to trick the opponent into believing an attack is coming from a different direction, or a different hand. While the grabbing of arms and heads is permitted, If the dance becomes a tussle the crowd will pull the two fighters apart. 

This art does not translate well into actual combat, where any and all weapons and techniques are employed by the tribe. 

**The Way of the Horrad:**

Great axes, Mauls and Warhammers, the Horrad’s goal is to cause as much chaos as possible in a single charge - More than any other style, the way of the Horrad is about forcing your opponent to either retreat or get knocked over under the weight of your weapon. If forced into drawn out combat, the Horrad usually applies the tactic of area denial. The Horrad will do its best to separate and surround fighters using the reach of their weapons. This art is particularly effective when used in conjunction with Boar Cavalry


**Yaomachtia:**

Meaning, “to be taught to fight”, a youth in Taxaluatl  learning Yaomachtia is taught the raiding and skirmishing tactics of the band. Unlike other arts, The youth is seldom taught to fight alone, rather it is presumed that they will always fight in their band - circling the opponent, using blowguns and slings to whittle them down and charging in with lightning fast dagger, handaxe and shortsword attacks. The goal of a Yaomachtia attack isn’t often to kill, but to wound and debilitate the opponent so that they are no longer able or willing to fight.
