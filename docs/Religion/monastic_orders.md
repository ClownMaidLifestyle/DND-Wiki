Overview:

The Divine Emanation that radiates from the cosmos above is a source of great power. Its interaction with the soul and mind are, for many, untapped potential. For those willing and able to dedicate their lives to understand this system, called Qi, A life of monasticism awaits. 

The combination of Academia, Physical Discipline, and intense Meditation make this pursuit challenging and life-consuming yet entirely rewarding. 

The Talariel Schools

The Elves were among the first to master Qi, owing to their long lives. The original master was known as Talariel. When his jealous rivals confronted him, demanding to know the source of his power, he merely vanished into the cosmos - leaving apprentices to carry on his wisdom.

The Talariel schools heavily focus on secrecy, carefully guarding their techniques and practises from those who would distort or abuse them. They find themselves supported by local lords as they can detect chaos and disruption along the emanation - Mass deaths, powerful magic and the actions of celestial beings (with varying specificity and accuracy). 

Calahara Nol Talariel

Leadership: Grandmaster Nuron, impossibly old even for Elves, spends all of his time in deep seclusion in Meria. Only the most critical decisions are brought to his attention, as interrupting his deep meditation is deeply frowned upon. 

Locations: Scattered throughout Imperium Meria, non-existent elsewhere

Practice: Inside Meria, monasticism is an honoured and respected profession but spaces are scarce. Young elves will have to dedicate much of their academy time to pursuing the monastic arts for the opportunity to join the Calahara Nol Talariel
