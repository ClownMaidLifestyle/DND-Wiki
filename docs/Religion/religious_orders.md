The Lord Trismegistus 

Symbol: ⴴ

Patron of: Humans 

Description: The first God in the world, his name means the lord thrice-great: referring to the three his three miracles: Shaping the world, Creating the first humans and ending the Tempest - When the Gods went to war - henceforth he is no longer present in this realm 

Church/Churches:

The church of the Lord Trismegistus - Their core tenant is that the Lord Trismegistus will one day return, bringing an era of peace and glory. With a large presence in the human kingdoms, there they operate a large part of the judiciary system along with providing the right to rule for their lords. 

Organisation: Based in Regitoise, the Millenialist Council - a collection of 20 elected bishops - is the primary religious authority in the church. The bishops are in charge of local areas, with high bishops in charge of metropolitan areas. These bishops are typically chosen by their predecessor or failing that, by the Local Assembly, the wider regional council underneath the Millenialist council. 

A church will be staffed with local healers, judges, groundskeepers and priests - depending on size

The Sacred Path: Part church, Part political organisation - The Sacred Path, based in Dragon’s Cairn, sees the decadence, luxuries and pride of humanity as an obstacle in the (sacred) path of the Lord Trismegistus’ return. As their members make their way up the rank they are required to make greater material sacrifices and urge others to do the same. 

Organisation: The Sacred Path is separated into study groups that meet regularly, the local Study groups have an area-wide meeting but ultimately they get their instructions from the mysterious leading committee 

The Tribulations of the Martyrs: Less of a church, more of a belief - The idea that the separatists who were killed by the empire of Regitoise during the civil war were divinely inspired is vehemently rejected by the official church, but is rising in popualrity in Antoine and Southmarche 

Organisation: While many attend official churches, some more radical believers prefer to pray at home 

Muatkatea

Symbol: ⵣ

Patron of: Tabaxi, Dragonborn, Satyr, Kenku

Description: Muatkatea hoped to emulate the second miracle by drawing on the inspiration of the wild animals as a starting point - bringing forth the animalistic races of the world. She is a prolific creator and many of her failed experiments became the ferocious humanoid beasts of the wilds. The Kenku betrayed her during the Tempest and for that she has not forgiven them, with a few individual exceptions/

Church/Churches

The Tabaxi tradition - the Tabaxi aim for a personal relationship with Muatkatea, their shamans use meditation and hallucinations to this end and pass on their relationship to the children of the clan. 

Organisation: Usually of their own children, a few assistants will serve a shaman, utilising the knowledge taught to them as children. Some of these will become shamans themselves. Specific rituals vary from clan to clan but inter-clan religious unity is usually brought through common traditions and consensus.

The Dragonborn tradition - Under the state faith of Amunra in Imhotep Muatkatea is considered worthy of reverence for creating the dragonborn. However, Imhotep is considered supreme for bringing ordered civil society and centuries of stability. There is an existing sect of Muatkaea’s “true believers ', usually in secret, that reject the notion of Amunra as a patron god and devote themselves only to her.

Organisation: In Imhotep, the true believer’s sects meet in darkness and secrecy, recruiting new members very carefully - usually utilising esoteric symbols and signs to communicate. They exist with much more freedom, however, in the pockets of dragonborn communities outside of Imhotep

The Antallian tradition - Both amongst the satyrs themselves and their Antallean Elven counterparts, Muatkatea plays an important religious role as a representation of both creation and chaos, she commonly features in plays as an instigating party in conflicts, sometimes creating a monster the hero has to slay and sometimes picking petty fights with other gods. This is not meant in irreverence, however: Antallian tradition simply dictates that even a patron god isn’t all good

Organisation: Antallian theologians earn followings during their public lectures and debates, and those who impress their intellectual heroes may find themselves partaking in the art of prose and debate themselves, earning their own positions as thought leaders. From there, the goal is to be allotted a temple charge by a great house. There is no official organisation and as such one’s religious career is entirely built on reputation. 

The Kenku tradition - Faith in the Kenku tribes is usually an individual affair, many wear charms and draw in the sand prayers with language of forgiveness, so Muatkatea will ease their burdens and guide them through troubles. Though, just as many will spend most of their lives not praying, seeing it as a foolish endeavour. 

Organisation: Religious traditions are spread through oral tradition, though the line between religion and culture is blurred to the point of meaningless, with religious language decorating entirely secular affairs and supposedly religious stories being almost entirely absent of the divine 

Elor

Symbol: ⵌ

Patron of: Dwarves, Gnomes, Orcs and Goblins

Description: Extremely proud of his Dwarves and Gnomes, Elor opted to spare them from the tempest - Creating the Orcs and Goblins as suitably warlike counterparts to take the risk of battle. 

Church/Churches: 

The Em Onol Service - Funded by the local City government - The Em Onol service provides humble and pious service for the people. Elor is a proud craftsman just as the dwarves, so they do not waste too much time in elaborate ritual, Though, their churches are certainly a work of art. 

 Organisation: Qualified, educated Dwarves apply for priesthood as a traditional employed position. Beyond religious service, their main priority is balancing the budget and keeping services efficient. Many dwarven children complain about being bored during service. 

The Gnomish tradition - Religion is largely a social affair in the Gnomish community - one carries Elor to meet their friends, to pray before sharing meals and to thank for successful crafts. Prayers are often engraved into tools and devices.

Organisation: Public schools teach religious studies but for those without access, homeschooling will do. There is no organised religion

Faedor

Symbol: Faedor’s Friend

Patron of: Elves

Description: Faedor considers his creation to be perfect, and his pride is unrivalled amongst the gods. If the tempest had a winner, it would be him. Except for the Antallean Elves who fled the battles, He maintained a contiguous race fiercely loyal to himself holding a large area of land, with no disappointments. 

Church/Churches: 

The Faedor Council: The Imperium Meria’s sole duty is its own survival, the expelling of imperfect races and the honing of the minds and bodies of the Elves inside. The Faedor council sees this as their highest duty as the chief religious authority and governing body of the imperium. 

Organisation: The council is self-running and their political authority is absolute, they select their membership through a complex and enigmatic series of metrics from genealogy to moral and political standing as well as academic performance. 

The Antallean Tradition: Faedor is a perplexing figure in Antallian culture, He is simultaneously revered for his divine creation and inward perfection but also depicted as a stubborn, prideful fool. 

Organisation: Antallian theologians earn followings during their public lectures and debates, and those who impress their intellectual heroes may find themselves partaking in the art of prose and debate themselves, earning their own positions as thought leaders. From there, the goal is to be allotted a temple charge by a great house. There is no official organisation and as such one’s religious career is entirely built on reputation.
