**Third Planar Beings:**

**Lunar Domain:**

**Ko’otan** - The Prince of the north star is revered amongst sailors for the navigation he can provide without a compass. He is respected on ships and in coastal towns so as to avoid offending the one who brings troubled seas and drives away fish. 

**T’ala** - While the reason why varies from culture to culture, universally T’ala is known to be violently jealous of pregnant women. They are usually blamed during a troubled pregnancy or miscarriage. 

**Lolain -** Lolain is a benevolent spirit who is known to lead the lost to safety. This also includes returning lost items to their rightful owner, making them a favourite of the victims of thieves

**Hierat -** Commonly known in druidic circles, Hierat is considered one of the easier beings to commune with. Though that does not mean making a request of them is always a good idea. The careless or foolish may find themselves struck dead if they annoy them. 

**Darratel** - Esoteric knowledge is Darratel’s speciality. They know the names of beasts that human eyes have yet laid eyes on, have seen ancient tomes long since destroyed and have knowledge of the divine that would kill mortals upon hearing it. Though he won’t give it up except in extraordinary circumstances

**Solar Domain:**

**Phe’on** - Pheo’on is credited with creating many seeds and fruits for the early mortals as well as teaching them to bake bread. They are very well known among farmers and cooks. Though, they have a wrathful side for the wasteful and greedy: Causing famines.

**Lona’a -** The prince of fortunes has unusual insight into the future. Their star is critical in the interpretation of auspicious births, as well the reading of future battles and economic ventures. They only, however, reveal fates indirectly. Misuse of their foresight would prove deadly and quite simply, they are not interested in meddling.

**Far’ala** - It is said their domain is a vast library containing all books written and many unwritten. They act as a guiding hand for scholars of particular renown, only however providing inspiration. 

**Alaal** - Alaa’s servants are vigilant in the defence of hallowed or consecrated ground, especially religious centres of all kinds.

**Wanderers:**

**Ka’ara** - The prince of Mundanus was charged with its safeguarding after the Tempest, as an assurance for the mortals left behind. The Knights Mundanus were established in their honour. 

**Ku’ela** - The prince of war is credited with deciding the fates of many famous historical armies, characterised by a thunderous chariot that roars over the battlefield, burning the eyes of anyone who gazes directly at it. They reward valour and save brilliant warriors from untimely deaths, so that they may flourish and impress them further.

**Arriel** - The messenger of the Gods is famously credited with visiting great religious figures; bringing prophecies, warnings and revelation. These visits are often spectacular, accompanied with a chorus of roaring trumpets and drums as well as astronomical phenomena like bursts of light in the dead of night.

**Toghk -** While the rot of the land of flesh, sa’al causes most disease: Toghk is called upon to orchestrate great plagues and blights upon unworthy rulers and impious populations. He upholds the honour of the celestial plane and the divine. 

**Second Planar Beings:**

**Ha’el -** One of the twins, Ha’el is the gatekeeper of the moon. No being shall pass without their knowing.

**Ko’aria** - The second twin, Ko’aria is the gatekeeper of the sun. When the two twins meet, they close both gates in combination - resulting in an eclipse. And total disconnection from the second plane for Mundanus, resulting in faltering magical power.

**Taha’ana -** The adjudicator’s divine court, backed by all the divine, is the supreme law of the celestial world. Inside the pure marble walls of the court time ceases to flow. It is said that proceedings may last thousands of years, and be delivered in the blink of an eye. Taha’ana negotiated the end of the Tempest

**Nae’ema -** When devout souls make their way up the planes, remaining unharmed, it is usually the result of Nae’ema and their servant guides. Souls will rest in Nae’emas domain before travelling to their final destination 

**First Planar Beings:**

**The Court of Elor:**

**The Paerator -** Elor’s tactician, general and soldier. They haven’t seen combat since the Tempest, making them one of the greatest sleepest giants in the cosmos. It is said their arms and armour were forged in the emanation itself

**Fa’ahtana -** Elor’s great orator first dictated the laws and customs of Elor to the dwarves and gnomes, while the gnomes maintain a purely oral tradition, the Dwarves’ legal customs are still a continuation of Fa’ahtana’s commands.

**Kalea** - There is nothing Kalea cannot make, they forged the Paerator’s armour and weapon.
