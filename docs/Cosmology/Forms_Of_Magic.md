The Four forms of Magic:

Radiance: The natural emanations from the divine bodies is known as radiance. This form of raw, undirected magic gets weaker as it dissipates down the realms - though it is known to congregate around holy sites and relics. This is the form of magic that wizards learn to manipulate with knowledge and bards with harmonies and vibrations. 

Trapped Radiance: A disciplined enchanter may draw radiance into a vessel, storing it for later bursts of power or as a continuous source of it. This is the first step to creating Qi, a technique few have mastered, and virtually none have achieved mortal souls.

Qi: Inside each and every living being is the magic that animates them and gives them beings - souls being an emergence of magic in the right forms and mass. Sorcerers, who have powerful souls, can extend their Qi out in explosive and dramatic ways.

Monks learn to attune their Qi to the radiance around them through intense meditation - this needs to be maintained as the Qi attempts to return to its natural position. This attunement allows them to sense the world around them and enables the Qi within them to flow where it is needed. 

Gratias: Beings of great Qi transcend the abilities of even sorcerers. Their souls are naturally attuned to the greater cosmos, especially the plane of reality they inhabit. They have no need for the intense study of wizards as manipulation of radiance comes naturally to them. From the Gods themselves to Celestial forces and the most powerful of Hellspawn - These creatures can grant Gratias to mortals.

Gratias refers to the magic imbued in the world or the soul by such a powerful being. This includes the divine favour of Clerics and the hellish pacts of warlocks - with few exceptions it can be taken away at will.
