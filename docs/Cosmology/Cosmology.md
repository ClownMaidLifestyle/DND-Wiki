**At the centre** of the cosmos exists a sphere of pure creation, this emanation is the beginning of all creation and it is so powerful that material things can only exist at a distance. 

**The Gods**, at the verge of emanation, are beings of almost pure creation with abstract forms. Four of these gods exist on the spurs of the emanation.

Existing in the **second highest celestial plane** are the most powerful celestial beings. They are often found in the divine courts of Gods, being closely aligned to them due to their creation occurring near the spur of a God. 

**The Third celestial plane** is separated by a firmament that only breaks in two places: The moon and the sun. The life force of the emanation is unbalanced, pouring through the sun more than the moon. This concentration of energy on the sun is where Amunra was created. Beyond these gateways exist the lesser Celestial beings. They are largely free agents split into three groups:

**The Lunar Domain**’s ****Beings have a larger degree of freedom, but are generally less powerful. They are known for intervening more in earthly affairs, particularly in mischievous ways and at night.

**The Solar Domain**’s Beings are more aloof, wielding tremendous power but generally refusing to deal with mortals. Throughout history, they have been credited with decisive and unexpected military victories and devastating natural events.

**The Wanderers** are observed by astronomers as the stars that move across the sky. These are generally the most unique and prominent figures in the Third Celestial Plane

 **Mundanus - or the Earthly Domain** is the last firmament the emanation touches. The Gods long ago created material beings with divine souls here, that last to this very day.

**Sa’al -** The land of flesh is the result of decay and rot dripping down through the earth and amalgamating below Mundanus. The residual life force brings forth horrific abominations, sometimes they seek to sustain themselves by devouring the rot around them. Others stalk the wayward souls of those who did not look after their spiritual health. The most sinister of all are the ones who gather the strength and wile to make their way to Mundanus itself

**Duat** is the hell of Amunra’s creation. His priesthood is endowed with the ability to damn his enemies’ souls to this fiery realm. Some say damned souls find their way back home, charred and starved, through the exit dug 500 years ago to wander the scorched desert of Kenkuia.

**Vo’al,** the third and final underworld can best be described as a vast sea of darkness. It is the land where being meets unbeing and any soul unfortunate enough to end up here, by accident or through magic, will likely never return. Amazingly, a scant few creatures exist in this sea, lying dormant to conserve the little energy they can possibly gain
