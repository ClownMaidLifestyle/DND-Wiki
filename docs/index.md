## The Commandments of Truth 

1. If any information contradicts the game itself, the game is the truth and that information is false

2. If any information except the game contradicts the wiki, the wiki is the truth and that information is false

3. If the wiki or game does not directly contradict your headcanon, presume it is the truth until proven false

4. The wiki is set in the time just before session 1, It does not contain any truth about events that happened after session 1 started 

5. No individual person (including the author of The Commandments of Truth) is a source of truth, anybody can contribute to a source of truth equally and without permission

**The game:** Anything that occurs during a session, anything written on a character sheet or any other material used during a session or any information that the DM divulges during a session. 

**The Wiki:** The current live version of this document on Github Pages 

**Headcanon:** Any information inferred from the first two sources of truth that is not positively confirmed by them.
