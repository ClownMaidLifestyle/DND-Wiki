Soldiers and mercenaries are expected to fight in formation, travel light with only the armour they need and train to be practical. There is no ritual combat in the isles, if you fight you mean to kill or maim.\u00a0</p> <p>The Derbaine School:</p> <p>The most popular, but not only, set of treatises on Combat in the human realm. The Derbaine school teaches rigorous forms for combat from wrestling with daggers to wielding halberds. The treatises were primarily focused on teaching nobility how to fight in heavy armour, though many lower ranking soldiers have learned to adapt its forms. Longswords, Halberds, maces and Daggers are common favourites for their ability to manoeuvre the enemy or pierce armour respectively.</p> <p>It is primarily based on controlling the distance between the enemy and manipulating their range of movement, as such grappling and barging techniques are commonly employed.\u00a0</p> <p>Students of the school and former soldiers often teach it in the employ of a Lord both to their children and their levies.\u00a0</p> <p>Nokhzam:</p> <p>The Duthnur\u2019s training regimen is prized for its excellent theories on the shield. Being short, Dwarves are taught to use a shield to close the gap with an opponent before using short blades and axes to target vital spots. The emphasis on shields also allows the Duthnur to control crowds effectively and capture groups or individuals in targeted actions. While generally seen as a defensive art, Nokhzam is actually more focused on allowing the Duthnur to push back or charge an opponent.\u00a0</p> <p>Azisdur:</p> <p>Where weapons are largely prohibited in the city, Self-defence schools have sprung up teaching a relatively newer art, Azisdur. The school is a double edged sword, making individual civilians safer but also acting as a training and recruitment den for organised criminals in some cases. The school teaches sturdy, powerful strikes and utilises the opponent\u2019s movements to throw them against a wall or on the ground. The overall mantra is rather opposite to Nokhzam, which teaches closing the gap - Azisdur is focused on making one hard to approach.\u00a0</p> <p>Tahtib:</p> <p>The army of Imhotep primarily learns to fight with sticks before graduating to lethal weapons. This teaches them that anything can be a weapon in the right hands and to use the momentum of their own body to put pressure on an opponent. With deadly dragon breath, the use of javelins, sickles and spears - The art of Tahtib is aggressive in its form, with its best proponents beginning their next attack halfway through a block.\u00a0</p> <p>Medjay training:</p> <p>A dying art since the dissolution of the Medjay Union, the Medjay were trained in the arts of desert survival, navigation and tracking all in aid of capturing wanted criminals and enemies of the state. They are experts in ambushes and other rapid, decisive tactics, especially against foes in greater numbers or who are likely to flee. They use bows, nets and swords extensively and are notorious for fighting dirty.\u00a0</p> <p>Kenkuian Blade Dances:</p> <p>The knife is one of the most important objects a Kenku can own. Heavy disputes are often solved with the parties being thrown into a circle of their peers, knife in hand. Few attacks are made, with feints and lunges being a staple feature as the opponents circle each other. Sleight of hand is often employed to trick the opponent into believing an attack is coming from a different direction, or a different hand. While the grabbing of arms and heads is permitted, If the dance becomes a tussle the crowd will pull the two fighters apart.\u00a0</p> <p>This art does not translate well into actual combat, where any and all weapons and techniques are employed by the tribe.\u00a0</p> <p>The Way of the Horrad:</p> <p>Great axes, Mauls and Warhammers, the Horrad\u2019s goal is to cause as much chaos as possible in a single charge - More than any other style, the way of the Horrad is about forcing your opponent to either retreat or get knocked over under the weight of your weapon. If forced into drawn out combat, the Horrad usually applies the tactic of area denial. The Horrad will do its best to separate and surround fighters using the reach of their weapons. This art is particularly effective when used in conjunction with Boar Cavalry</p> <p>Yaomachtia:</p> <p>Meaning, \u201cto be taught to fight\u201d, a youth in Taxaluatl\u00a0 learning Yaomachtia is taught the raiding and skirmishing tactics of the band. Unlike other arts, The youth is seldom taught to fight alone, rather it is presumed that they will always fight in their band - circling the opponent, using blowguns and slings to whittle them down and charging in with lightning fast dagger, handaxe and shortsword attacks. The goal of a Yaomachtia attack isn\u2019t often to kill, but to wound and debilitate the opponent so that they are no longer able or willing to fight.</p>"},{"location":"Cosmology/Celestial_Beings/","title":"Celestial Beings","text":"<p>Third Planar Beings:</p> <p>Lunar Domain:</p> <p>Ko\u2019otan - The Prince of the north star is revered amongst sailors for the navigation he can provide without a compass.

Their star is critical in the interpretation of auspicious births, as well the reading of future battles and economic ventures. They only, however, reveal fates indirectly.

They reward valour and save brilliant warriors from untimely deaths, so that they may flourish and impress them further.</p> <p>Arriel - The messenger of the Gods is famously credited with visiting great religious figures; bringing prophecies, warnings and revelation. These visits are often spectacular, accompanied with a chorus of roaring trumpets and drums as well as astronomical phenomena like bursts of light in the dead of night.</p> <p>Toghk - While the rot of the land of flesh, sa\u2019al causes most disease: Toghk is called upon to orchestrate great plagues and blights upon unworthy rulers and impious populations.

No being shall pass without their knowing.</p> <p>Ko\u2019aria - The second twin, Ko\u2019aria is the gatekeeper of the sun. When the two twins meet, they close both gates in combination - resulting in an eclipse. And total disconnection from the second plane for Mundanus, resulting in faltering magical power.</p> <p>Taha\u2019ana - The adjudicator\u2019s divine court, backed by all the divine, is the supreme law of the celestial world. Inside the pure marble walls of the court time ceases to flow. It is said that proceedings may last thousands of years, and be delivered in the blink of an eye. Taha\u2019ana negotiated the end of the Tempest</p> <p>Nae\u2019ema - When devout souls make their way up the planes, remaining unharmed, it is usually the result of Nae\u2019ema and their servant guides. Souls will rest in Nae\u2019emas domain before travelling to their final destination\u00a0</p> <p>First Planar Beings:</p> <p>The Court of Elor:</p> <p>The Paerator - Elor\u2019s tactician, general and soldier. They haven\u2019t seen combat since the Tempest, making them one of the greatest sleepest giants in the cosmos. It is said their arms and armour were forged in the emanation itself</p> <p>Fa\u2019ahtana - Elor\u2019s great orator first dictated the laws and customs of Elor to the dwarves and gnomes, while the gnomes maintain a purely oral tradition, the Dwarves\u2019 legal customs are still a continuation of Fa\u2019ahtana\u2019s commands.</p> <p>Kalea - There is nothing Kalea cannot make, they forged the Paerator\u2019s armour and weapon.\u00a0</p>"},{"location":"Cosmology/Cosmology/","title":"Cosmology","text":"<p>Overview</p> <p>**</p> <p>At the centre of the cosmos exists a sphere of pure creation, this emanation is the beginning of all creation and it is so powerful that material things can only exist at a distance.\u00a0</p> <p>The Gods, at the verge of emanation, are beings of almost pure creation with abstract forms.

Prestige and standing must be earned, not inherited. The foreign nobility are well treated and accommodated, but nobility has no place in Cairnian society.  </li> <li>Drink \u2013 Attitudes are highly mixed. Hedonists are admonished by the Sacred Path, but many enjoy a break from the realities of industrial work. Many fine imports are available, even to middle-income craftsmen if they save up.  </li> <li>Culture \u2013 Here, all culture is in a state of flux and experimentation, with customs from across the world blending together to create a uniquely Dragon\u2019s Cairn style. Every niche is catered for if you know where to look.  </li> <li>Marriage \u2013 The church is permitted to officiate weddings, but the state provides that service independently for the non-human population.  </li> <li>Outsiders \u2013 The naive foreigner may think the streets are paved with gold from the promises of sailors and recruiters, but the truth can be far from that fantasy. Many move here in search of money and find poverty and crime instead, joining the ranks of the working population. Others make it. Some are simply tourists and have a pleasant time. All are expected and commonplace for the locals. Judgement is sometimes based on racial lines, as continental conflicts bleed over into street violence.  </li> <li>Violence \u2013 To the resentment of the working man, gangs and the guard alike are happy to push and shove to control the populace. Peace is heavily kept in touristed areas, but in the working quarters, it\u2019s very easy to slip through the cracks and wind up dead.  </li> <li>Slavery \u2013 The promise of individual liberty and a fortune to be had are tantamount to the social fabric. There are no masters here. But punishing contracts can feel just the same as forced servitude once they\u2019ve been signed.  </li> <li>Magic \u2013 With exemptions for authorised professions, the public use of magic is prohibited. Express permission must be granted due to the grave danger it poses to the public. A flash in a crowd could lead to panic.  </li> <li>Money \u2013 Money is what keeps your head above the water and what determines which opportunities you have access to. More than anywhere else in the world, you are worth the coin in your purse.  </li> <li>Family \u2013 While wider society may have embraced the republic, the family unit is still a kingdom. Short only of financial ruin, it is a complete disgrace to fail to provide for your family. Loyalty is usually expected in return.  </li> <li>Death \u2013 The handful of churches on the island billow smoke constantly from the bodies of the dead. Other provisions are available but more specialist and expensive. Most people have a short service at their closest church\u2014death is a family matter.  </li> <li>Religion \u2013 Anybody is welcome to choose their creed, but the church is treated with heavy scepticism, and this applies also to other groups.

They parley even among rival troops, sometimes in secret, to share knowledge and perform rituals in honour of Elor. non-member korrats have a difficult relationship with the warborn - wanting to employ its members' valuable insight and potions in battle, but wary of a competing power structure. </p> <p>Organisation: Both the North and South Steppes have Warborn Covenants within the ranks of the Troops. Joining is invitation only, members identify each other through secret code phrases. </p> <p>Obligations: -Perform rituals in Elor\u2019s honour -Fight the enemies of Elor as is your birthright -Protect the secrecy of the tradition but pass on its knowledge</p>"},{"location":"Religion/monastic_orders/","title":"Monastic orders","text":"<p>The Divine Emanation that radiates from the cosmos above is a source of great power. Its interaction with the soul and mind are, for many, untapped potential. For those willing and able to dedicate their lives to understand this system, called Qi, A life of monasticism awaits. </p> <p>The combination of Academia, Physical Discipline, and intense Meditation make this pursuit challenging and life-consuming yet entirely rewarding. </p> <p>The Talariel Schools</p> <p>The Elves were among the first to master Qi, owing to their long lives. The original master was known as Talariel. When his jealous rivals confronted him, demanding to know the source of his power, he merely vanished into the cosmos - leaving apprentices to carry on his wisdom.</p> <p>The Talariel schools heavily focus on secrecy, carefully guarding their techniques and practises from those who would distort or abuse them. They find themselves supported by local lords as they can detect chaos and disruption along the emanation - Mass deaths, powerful magic and the actions of celestial beings (with varying specificity and accuracy). </p> <p>Calahara Nol Talariel</p> <p>Leadership: Grandmaster Nuron, impossibly old even for Elves, spends all of his time in deep seclusion in Meria. Only the most critical decisions are brought to his attention, as interrupting his deep meditation is deeply frowned upon. </p> <p>Locations: Scattered throughout Imperium Meria, non-existent elsewhere</p> <p>Practice: Inside Meria, monasticism is an honoured and respected profession but spaces are scarce. Young elves will have to dedicate much of their academy time to pursuing the monastic arts for the opportunity to join the Calahara Nol Talariel </p>"},{"location":"Religion/religious_orders/","title":"Religious orders","text":"<p>The Lord Trismegistus </p> <p>Symbol: \u2d34</p> <p>Patron of: Humans </p> <p>Description: The first God in the world, his name means the lord thrice-great: referring to the three his three miracles: Shaping the world, Creating the first humans and ending the Tempest - When the Gods went to war - henceforth he is no longer present in this realm </p> <p>Church/Churches:</p> <p>The church of the Lord Trismegistus - Their core tenant is that the Lord Trismegistus will one day return, bringing an era of peace and glory. With a large presence in the human kingdoms, there they operate a large part of the judiciary system along with providing the right to rule for their lords. </p> <p>Organisation: Based in Regitoise, the Millenialist Council - a collection of 20 elected bishops - is the primary religious authority in the church. The bishops are in charge of local areas, with high bishops in charge of metropolitan areas. These bishops are typically chosen by their predecessor or failing that, by the Local Assembly, the wider regional council underneath the Millenialist council. </p> <p>A church will be staffed with local healers, judges, groundskeepers and priests - depending on size</p> <p>The Sacred Path: Part church, Part political organisation - The Sacred Path, based in Dragon\u2019s Cairn, sees the decadence, luxuries and pride of humanity as an obstacle in the (sacred) path of the Lord Trismegistus\u2019 return. As their members make their way up the rank they are required to make greater material sacrifices and urge others to do the same. </p> <p>Organisation: The Sacred Path is separated into study groups that meet regularly, the local Study groups have an area-wide meeting but ultimately they get their instructions from the mysterious leading committee </p> <p>The Tribulations of the Martyrs: Less of a church, more of a belief - The idea that the separatists who were killed by the empire of Regitoise during the civil war were divinely inspired is vehemently rejected by the official church, but is rising in popualrity in Antoine and Southmarche </p> <p>Organisation: While many attend official churches, some more radical believers prefer to pray at home </p> <p>Muatkatea</p> <p>Symbol: \u2d63</p> <p>Patron of: Tabaxi, Dragonborn, Satyr, Kenku</p> <p>Description: Muatkatea hoped to emulate the second miracle by drawing on the inspiration of the wild animals as a starting point - bringing forth the animalistic races of the world. She is a prolific creator and many of her failed experiments became the ferocious humanoid beasts of the wilds. The Kenku betrayed her during the Tempest and for that she has not forgiven them, with a few individual exceptions/</p> <p>Church/Churches</p> <p>The Tabaxi tradition - the Tabaxi aim for a personal relationship with Muatkatea, their shamans use meditation and hallucinations to this end and pass on their relationship to the children of the clan. </p> <p>Organisation: Usually of their own children, a few assistants will serve a shaman, utilising the knowledge taught to them as children. Some of these will become shamans themselves. Specific rituals vary from clan to clan but inter-clan religious unity is usually brought through common traditions and consensus.</p> <p>The Dragonborn tradition - Under the state faith of Amunra in Imhotep Muatkatea is considered worthy of reverence for creating the dragonborn. However, Imhotep is considered supreme for bringing ordered civil society and centuries of stability. There is an existing sect of Muatkaea\u2019s \u201ctrue believers ', usually in secret, that reject the notion of Amunra as a patron god and devote themselves only to her.</p> <p>Organisation: In Imhotep, the true believer\u2019s sects meet in darkness and secrecy, recruiting new members very carefully - usually utilising esoteric symbols and signs to communicate. They exist with much more freedom, however, in the pockets of dragonborn communities outside of Imhotep</p> <p>The Antallian tradition - Both amongst the satyrs themselves and their Antallean Elven counterparts, Muatkatea plays an important religious role as a representation of both creation and chaos, she commonly features in plays as an instigating party in conflicts, sometimes creating a monster the hero has to slay and sometimes picking petty fights with other gods. This is not meant in irreverence, however: Antallian tradition simply dictates that even a patron god isn\u2019t all good</p> <p>Organisation: Antallian theologians earn followings during their public lectures and debates, and those who impress their intellectual heroes may find themselves partaking in the art of prose and debate themselves, earning their own positions as thought leaders. From there, the goal is to be allotted a temple charge by a great house. There is no official organisation and as such one\u2019s religious career is entirely built on reputation. </p> <p>The Kenku tradition - Faith in the Kenku tribes is usually an individual affair, many wear charms and draw in the sand prayers with language of forgiveness, so Muatkatea will ease their burdens and guide them through troubles. Though, just as many will spend most of their lives not praying, seeing it as a foolish endeavour. </p> <p>Organisation: Religious traditions are spread through oral tradition, though the line between religion and culture is blurred to the point of meaningless, with religious language decorating entirely secular affairs and supposedly religious stories being almost entirely absent of the divine </p> <p>Elor</p> <p>Symbol: \u2d4c</p> <p>Patron of: Dwarves, Gnomes, Orcs and Goblins</p> <p>Description: Extremely proud of his Dwarves and Gnomes, Elor opted to spare them from the tempest - Creating the Orcs and Goblins as suitably warlike counterparts to take the risk of battle. </p> <p>Church/Churches: </p> <p>The Em Onol Service - Funded by the local City government - The Em Onol service provides humble and pious service for the people. Elor is a proud craftsman just as the dwarves, so they do not waste too much time in elaborate ritual, Though, their churches are certainly a work of art. </p> <p>Organisation: Qualified, educated Dwarves apply for priesthood as a traditional employed position. Beyond religious service, their main priority is balancing the budget and keeping services efficient. Many dwarven children complain about being bored during service. </p> <p>The Gnomish tradition - Religion is largely a social affair in the Gnomish community - one carries Elor to meet their friends, to pray before sharing meals and to thank for successful crafts. Prayers are often engraved into tools and devices.</p> <p>Organisation: Public schools teach religious studies but for those without access, homeschooling will do. There is no organised religion</p> <p>Faedor</p> <p>Symbol: Faedor\u2019s Friend</p> <p>Patron of: Elves</p> <p>Description: Faedor considers his creation to be perfect, and his pride is unrivalled amongst the gods. If the tempest had a winner, it would be him. Except for the Antallean Elves who fled the battles, He maintained a contiguous race fiercely loyal to himself holding a large area of land, with no disappointments. </p> <p>Church/Churches: </p> <p>The Faedor Council: The Imperium Meria\u2019s sole duty is its own survival, the expelling of imperfect races and the honing of the minds and bodies of the Elves inside. The Faedor council sees this as their highest duty as the chief religious authority and governing body of the imperium. </p> <p>Organisation: The council is self-running and their political authority is absolute, they select their membership through a complex and enigmatic series of metrics from genealogy to moral and political standing as well as academic performance. </p> <p>The Antallean Tradition: Faedor is a perplexing figure in Antallian culture, He is simultaneously revered for his divine creation and inward perfection but also depicted as a stubborn, prideful fool. </p> <p>Organisation: Antallian theologians earn followings during their public lectures and debates, and those who impress their intellectual heroes may find themselves partaking in the art of prose and debate themselves, earning their own positions as thought leaders. From there, the goal is to be allotted a temple charge by a great house. There is no official organisation and as such one\u2019s religious career is entirely built on reputation. </p>"}]}
